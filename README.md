# Hand-Gesture-Open-CV
Hand tracking model using Python which uses Computer Vision to identify hand movements using webcam.
Used OpenCV which helps to implement Real-Time Computer Vision along with Google Mediapipe to import
inbuilt functions.
Model is a basic prototype which can act as a base and be imported to create various other projects which uses
handtracking like volume controlling , virtual on screen keyboard etc.


It uses various pre-defined 21 points in the hand including fingertips,curves to give an provide an accurate tracking mechanism.
We can also see at the bottom left the co-ordinates are being updated with every moment to provide an clear idea of the accuracy of the model.
